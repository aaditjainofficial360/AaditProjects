Challenge: Generate all Permutations of a List (*)

Write a Python program that generates and prints all the possible permutations of a list.

A permutation is a possible arrangement of the elements of the list. For example, [2, 1, 3] is a permutation of [1, 2, 3].

Print each permutation as a list on a separate line. You can print them as lists or tuples.

Include the list itself as a permutation.

print(generate_permutations(sample1))
